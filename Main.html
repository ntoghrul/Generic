    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>This algorithms is for simulating natural selection. First, we have some population of individuals(balls) and all of those individuals have genes(which represents their behaviours). In our sample the genes are 2d vectors that indicate the point where the balls move in a time on a 2d plane.We give random genes when the program starts. Moreover, there is a small blue square and the balls should reach the square to survive. So, when we generate next generations, everytime we take the genes of the previous generations who move close to the square.As generations evolved they move  closer to the square. After certain time passed, we can see that they start to reach blue square which means they survive.Genetic algorithm is also great example of machine learning. </p>
